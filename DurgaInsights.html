        </b></h2></big>
        <ARTICLE><P>
            <b>DURGA</b> if simply understood is <b>one form the supreme energy</b>.Durga is <b>epitome of knowledge,beauty and bravery.</b>
            According to the ancient scriptures, when there was absolutely nothing,before time and universe came into existance,there was a small core of energy which created everything.The <b>core of energy</b> is called <B>Adi ParaShakti</B> or simply <B>AdiShakti</B>.
            'Adi' is a sanskrit word meaning 'at the beginning' or 'the first one'.'Para' means 'above everything' or 'away and supreme to anything'.'Shakti' simply means 'power' or 'energy'.So this all combined means that <b>AdiParaShakti is the 'first form of supreme energy' or  'the most supreme form of energy which existed at the beginning or even before the beginning of everything or anything and will be there till the end or even after the end too'.</b>Firstly the core of energy took a feminine form called AdiShakti,seen as the the <b>supremely divine mother</b> of anything that could or could not exist.She then created a masculine form to accompany her watching over the universe.The masculine form that she created is known as AdiYogi,MahaKaal,Shiva,Shambhu,Rudra and many more names.
          </P>
          <p>
            <b>Shiva then did severe penance to the AdiShakti</b> to lend him the sidhhis and knowledge.Adishakti granted him all the sidhhis.With help of all the sidhhis<b> he created Vishnu who later created Brahma</b>.Adishakti granted the trinity with their shaktis or we could say their partners accompaning them in the path of ruling the universe.AdiShakti gave Shiva his power(Shakti) in the form of <b>Sati</b> who incarnated as the <b>daughter of the mighty king Prajapati Daksh</b>.She granted <b>Vishnu with his shakti-Lakshmi</b> and <b>Brahma with his shakti-Saraswati</b>.It is also said that <b>Sati was the first and actual incarnation of AdiShakti.</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            What did Sati do? What did happen to her? Who was Kaal Bhairav? Who was Parvati? What was her perpose? These all question are for the story to be told any later time.Now let's focus on the Origin story of Durga.
          </p>
        </ARTICLE>
        <article>
          <h2><b><big>Origin of Durga</big></b></h2>

          <p> According to the Puranas, <b>Aditi, Diti, and Danu are daughters of Daksha,</b> who married Sage Kashyapa. <b>The Auras (Daityas) were born to Diti, the Devas (Adityas) were born to Aditi, and Danavas were born to Danu.</b> But, their <b>sons were always in conflict and battle for a higher place in the universe.</b> Devas are on one side, whereas Asuras and Danavas are on the other.
Once Devas killed all the sons of Diti. Mother of Asuras was deeply grief-stricken and bewildered. She asked her daughter to penance intensely and get a <b>boon to have a mighty son who could defeat Indra.</b> As a result of the intense penance, her daughter received a boon from <b></b>Sage Suparshwa.</b></P>

<p> Suparshwa said: You will have <b>a son with  buffalo’s face and a man’s bodily form.</b> This son of yours named Mahiṣa will be <b>extremely vigorous and mighty.</b> He will harass heaven and Devendra along with his army.</P> 

    <p> As a result, the son<b> Mahisaura was born to her</b>.
Mahisasura was extremely powerful, and he wanted to harass Devas in Indra Loka. He sent a messenger to Lord India so that he could submit his Kingdom and accept Mahisasura as an emperor. Indra responded to the messenger with complete disdain and his master Mahiṣa. The messenger returned and told Mahiṣāsura, who became very angry and decided to attack Devas and take control of the Deva or Indra Loka.</P>

<p> Devas took <b>shelter in the mountains</b> for hundreds of years. They decided to <b>take revenge and kill the Mahisasura.</b> All the Devas came together to pray to Lord Brahma and ask for help, as Mahisasura had received the boon from Brahma himself that no man could kill him.

Lord Brahma took all the Devas to<b> Vaikuntha to meet Vishnu and asked Shiva to join them.</b> In the presence of Trinity Gods, Devas asked for a solution so Mahisasura could be killed and liberate the three worlds from his unlawful empire.

Lord Vishnu said to them – <b>“By the boon, a woman can only kill Mahisasura. If we can create a woman who is part of the Devas with their power and glory, we could kill him with her help. So let us try to create such a mighty woman, concentrating all our powers on her. After her creation, we must give her all our weapons.”</b>

As soon as Vishnu spoke these words, <b>the trimurtis became enraged.</b> The faces became so horrifying that it was difficult to look at them. The Devas saw a<b> great mass of blazing light coming from the bodies of Indra and the other enraged gods. The bright light looked like a burning mountain, spreading its flames in all directions.</b></P>

<p> <b>This glowing mass of light took the shape of a woman. The radiance of Shiva became her face; that of Vishnu her arms, and that of Brahma her feet. Similarly, the radiance of Indra became the waistline. Thebraidss was formed with the light of Yama and the breasts with the light of the Moon.

The shanks and the thighs evolved out of the Varuṇa. Mother Earth became the hips and the loins, and that of the Sun became the toes of the feet. The fingers of the hands were shaped with the splendor of Vasus; the nose was made out of the refulgence of Kubera. The nine Prajapatis become the rows of teeth. The pair of eyes was formed out of the brilliance of Agni Deva.</b>

In a moment, all these figures became one and changed into a <b>woman with divine beauty and eighteen arms. This woman of exquisite beauty, combining all the powers and glories of all the Devas, was Devi herself. The devas gave her jewels and ornaments and gorgeous clothes.</b>

She roared out loudly as if to shake heaven and earth. The Goddess’s deafening roar caused unrest throughout the universe.

Riding on a lion. she took her stand at the entrance of Devaloka and challenged Mahisasura. Mahisasura was extremely angry. He picked up his large weapons and, accompanied by Asuras, headed towards the sound.</P>

<p> When Mahisasura saw Goddess Durga for the first time,<b> he fell in love with her.</b> She said she would marry someone who could beat her in a fight. A fierce battle between the Asuras headed by Mahisa and Devas led by Devi begins. Mahisa is determined to defeat her. It was a brutal fight.

With the support of Devi, Devas became very motivated and killed many Asura soldiers, which made  Mahisasura furious. Out of anger, he attacked devas with his mighty weapons and arrows; Devas fled. They sought refuge in the Goddess, asking for her support to help them.

The Devi told her own Ganas to destroy the Asura armies quickly. She said she would fight Mahiṣa in the battle because he was very confident because of his strength. Then all of the Asura armies were killed by the Ganas of Devi quickly. Seeing his army destroyed by the Ganas of Goddess, he fought them back and defeated all of the Ganas.</P>

<p> In the meantime, the generals and ministers of Mahisa wanted to fight with Devi and stood in front of her.

Devi then rode on her vehicle, the lion, at the speed of the mind. She seized her dreadful bow of loud report like that of the cloud at the time of the world destruction. She made a twanging sound and discharged many arrows of adamantine strength at the speed of the wind. Goddess Durga killed the entire army of powerful asuras.

When Durga killed his army,<b> Mahisasura became a buffalo</b> and started devouring the Gaṇas of Devi. He killed some with his snout and others by kicking them with his hoofs. The theenragedd demon also toppled down others with the impact of his exhalation.</P>

<p>  After killing Devi’s army, Mahisasura ran toward her lion to kill it.

Durga’s ride became infuriated and roared. Then the lion of great strength became furious. With his paws, he dug the ground and broke the mountains. As Mahisasura came near, he tore him up with his claws. The wrathful Chandika intended to kill him then.

In her excessive anger, Chandika bound the Buffalo-headed demon using ropes and nooses. The demon got himself released from the nooses and abandoned the guise of buffalo.

Mahisa then adopted <b>the form of a lion.</b> When Devi was ready to cut off his head, he became a man with a sword in his hand. With multitudes of arrows with sharp points capable of tearing vulnerable spots, Goddess struck that man with the sword in his hand. Then that man became an<b> elephant with a trunk and two tusks</b>. With its trunk, it pulled the lion. Thereupon, <b>the lion splits its trunk using its claws.</b></P>

<p> Finally, the Mother of the universe, Goddess Durga, spoke to Mahisasura:

<b>O foolish, you can be proud for a little while as long as I drink this liquor. After I drink this liquor, I will send you to Yama’s abode. After you have been killed, unassailable up to this point, and have been a thorn to the Devas, let the Siddhas, Sadhyas, and groups of Maruts return to their respective posts.</b></P>

<p> After speaking, the Goddess hit Mahisasura <b>with her fist.</b> Upon being hit, Mahisa became scared and ran away to the Southern Sea. The Goddess chased him on her lion vehicle.

Pursued by the Goddess, Mahisasura entered the<b> waters of Dharmapuskarini.</b> Agitated by the blow of Durga Maa, he remained hidden therein. Then Durga Maa came to the banks of Dharmapuskarini. Goddess asks her vehicle, Lion, to drink all the water and dry up the Dharmapuskarini.

Thereupon the dejected Mahisasura came out of the water reservoir. As the Asura approached her, the angry Devi<b> placed her foot on the head of the Asura and hit his neck with her spear. Then Devi seized her sword and cut off his colossal head. Thus, Asura and Danava king Mahisasura was slain by Goddess Durga. He fell to the ground and died.</b></P>

<p>All the Devas, Yogis, Siddhas, Gandharvas, Yakshas, and Humans of heaven of earth eulogized Devi with prayers. Goddess Durga from this day is also known to be<b> Mahisasura Mardini – Slayer of Mahishasura</b>.</p>

        <h2> <b> <big>2.WHICH FORM OF HER DOES SHE POSSESS FOR HER EXISTANCE?</big></b></h2>
        <ARTICLE>
            <p> 
                 Maa Durga is popularly depicted as a<b> Goddess wearing red clothes.</b> The red clothes signify <b> fierceness in fighting evil</b>, and the arms suggest that the Devi Durga protects her devotee from all directions. Being a divine mother and a protector, she is depicted as <b> having eight or ten hands. </b>These represent eight quadrants or ten directions in Hinduism <b> to protect us from all those directions.</b>

                    <p> The weapons held by Durga are given to her by each of the Gods and symbolize the culmination of all the divine powers in her – Shiva’s trident or Trishul, Vishnu’s discus or Sudarshana chakra, Brahma’s Kamandalu, Indra’s thunderbolt, Kuber’s Ratnahar and other weapons given by different Gods. This also suggested that Durga possesses all the weapons necessary to fight evil. The lotus in Durga’s hand is known as Pankaja and symbolizes the evolution of spirituality among the evils prevalent in this world. Goddess Durga also holds a conch in one of her hands which is known to produce the sound of ‘Om’, which is equivalent to the sound of God in Hinduism. The lion or tiger represents complete power and determination implying that these virtues are required to obtain victory over evil.
                    </P>
                    <p> In Hindu texts, Durga is frequently depicted <b> standing atop or riding a tiger or lion, which represents power, will, and determination.</b> In riding this fearsome beast, Durga symbolizes her mastery over all these qualities. Her bold pose is called <b> Abhay Mudra, which means “freedom from fear.”</b> Just as the mother goddess confronts evil without fear, Hindu scripture teaches, so too should Hindu faithful conduct themselves in a righteous, courageous way.
                     </P>
                        <p> Like her consort Lord Shiva, the goddess Durga is also referred to as <b> Triyambake, the three-eyed goddess.</b> Her left eye represents desire, symbolized by the moon; her right eye represents action, symbolized by the sun; and her middle eye stands for knowledge, symbolized by fire.
                         </P>

        <ARTICLE>
            <h2><b> <big>3.WHOM DOES SHE HAVE AS HER PARTNER?</big></b></h2>
            <P> Goddess Durga is the beloved wife of Shiva, the destroyer of the universe. 
                
                <h2><b><big> What is the meaning of Shiva? </big></b></h2>
                
                <P> Shiva is "that which is not" and because Adiyogi perceived that dimension which is the source of creation, he came to be known as Shiva.</P>
                
                <P> Supreme BrahmanShiva is described as a<b>  non-being, not as a being.</b> Shiva is not described as light, but <b> as darkness.</b> Humanity has gone about eulogizing light only because of the nature of the visual apparatus that they carry. Otherwise, the only thing that is always, is darkness. Light is a limited happening in the sense that any source of light – whether a light bulb or the sun – will eventually lose its ability to give out light. Light is not eternal. It is always a limited possibility because it happens and it ends. <b> Darkness is a much bigger possibility than light.</b> Nothing needs to burn, it is always – <b> it is eternal.</b> Darkness is everywhere. It is the only thing that is all pervading.</P>
                
                <P> So “Shiva” refers to both “that which is not,” and Adiyogi, because in many ways, they are synonymous. This being, who is <b> a yogi, and that non-being, which is the basis of the existence,</b> are the same, because to call someone a yogi means he has <b> experienced the existence as himself.</b></P>

                <P>  If you have to contain the existence within you even for a moment as an experience, <b> you have to be that nothingness.</b> Only nothingness can hold everything. Something can never hold everything. A vessel cannot hold an ocean. This planet can hold an ocean, but it cannot hold the solar system. The solar system can hold these few planets and the sun, but it cannot hold the rest of the galaxy. If you go progressively like this, ultimately you will see it is <b> only nothingness that can hold everything</b>.</P>

            </b></h2></big>

                <p> First of all Durga is not a goddess or incarnation of any other being.She is the supreme nature.</p>
                <p> It is said that AdiShakti at the time of giving Shiva his consort,<b> incarnated herself as Sati</b> and in the next birth <b> Parvati who married Shiva.</b>So Devi Parvati is oftenlty considered as AdiShakti herself.Parvati then also showed her showed <b> fierce form of MahaKaali.</b>Sometimes MahaKaali is said to be the real/actual consort to Shiva.But in conclusion,these all forms are of Devi Parvati,<b> All are one! Durga,Mahakaali,Parvati all are one and avatars of only one supreme being,Adishakti.</b></p>
                <p> Durga can also be seen as the Warrior form/Avatar of Devi Parvati.Mahakaali is seen as the slayer and destroyer form of Parvati.<b> Parvati has taken these form in different times to kill different types of demons</b> but at the root it is all just one being Devi Parvati,the incarnation of AdiShakti.</p>
                <p> <b> She is the root consort to Shiva </b>and she resides with him in the <b> form of MahaGauri,another form of herself</b>.Parvati is the <b> mother nature</b>.Shiva is the nothingness and darkness,and Parvati is the<b>  matter and energy in it.</b>  </p>

6.WHY IS SHE CONSIDERED TO BE THE ULTIMATE GODDESS?
 </b></h2></BIG>
<P> <b> Durga - the goddess of power and strength, is perhaps the most important goddess of the Hindus.</b> She is a multi-dimensional Goddess, with many names, many personas, and many facets. As Mahishasuramardini or Shakti,<b> she is the destroyer of evil - with her ten mighty arms carrying lethal weapons she triumphantly slays the demon Mahishasura.</b></P>

<P>  As Sati, beloved daughter of King Daksha and Queen Menaka she gives up a kingdom and earns her father's wrath. As Kali, she turns black as the night and omnipotent, terrible in rage and fury, with just a string of skulls as her garland and her only garb. As Parvati, she is serene, the pretty consort of Lord Shiva by his side in the snowy peaks of the Kailash mountain. <b> She is Bhawani, symbol of life. She is Sati, the object of death. She is Basanti, the heralder of springtime. She is also Amba, Jagadhatri, Tara, Ambika, Annapurna.</b></P>
<P> <b> She is the embodiement of purity, knowledge, truth and self-realization.</b> The highest form of truth present in any being or Jiva is known as "Aatman" or supreme consciousness. This supreme consciousness or the absolute soul is infinite, birthless, deathless, beyond time and space, and beyond the law of causation. <b> Goddess Durga is the inherent dynamic energy through which this supreme consciousness manifests itself.</b></P>
<P> 

<b> Goddess Durga represents the power of the Supreme Being that preserves moral order and righteousness in the universe.  </b> She is the energy aspect of the Lord Shiva. Without Durga, Lord Shiva has no expression and without Shiva, Durga has no existence. Lord Shiva is only the silent witness. He is motionless, absolutely changeless. He is not affected by the cosmic play. Shiva has no direct connection with the tangible elements in the universe and is obliged to emanate a manifestation, an emission of energy, shakti, through the goddess. It is Durga who is the doer of all actions.<b>  Shiva and Durga are regarded as the twofold personalization of Brahman, the primeval substance.</b></P>
<P> 

<b> Durga is not only a powerful force for cosmic order but also a protector of her devotees.</b> She listens to her devotees and attends to their needs. The Devi Mahatmya describes her as a personal savior who will save her devotees from forest fires, wild animals, robbers, imprisonment, execution, and battle.</P>
<P> 

Goddess Durga keeps up the play of the divine universal God through <b> the three attributes of Nature, namely, Satva (equilibrium and serenity), Rajas (dynamism and kinesis) and Tamas (ignorance and inertia).</b> Knowledge, peace, lust, anger, greed, egoism and pride, all are Her forms. <b> Maha Saraswati is Her Sattviki Shakti or power of equilibrium. Maha Lakshmi is Her Rajasik Shakti or power of activity. And Maha Kali is Her Tamsik Shakti the power of destruction.</b> All these are feminine forms.</P>
<P> 
<B>Shiva's power is Shakti, the dynamic creative mother aspect of the Godhead. It is she who creates and at the time of dissolution, it is she who swallows her own creation. Shakti cannot exist without Shiva and Shiva cannot personify without Shakti.</b>
